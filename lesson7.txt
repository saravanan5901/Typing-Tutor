'The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick'
“Pad kid poured curd pulled cold.”
A big bug bit a bold bald bear and the bold bald bear bled blood badly.
Brisk brave brigadiers brandished broad bright blades,blunderbusses,and bludgeons--Balancing them badly.
Can you can a canned can into an uncanned can like a canner can can a canned can into an uncanned can?
A tutor who tooted the flute
Tried to tutor two tooters to toot
Said the two to the tutor
"Is it tougher to toot"
Or to tutor two tooters to toot?
Silly Sally swiftly shooed seven silly sheep.
The seven silly sheep Silly Sally shooed
Shilly-shallied south.
These sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack;
Sheep should sleep in a shed.$
